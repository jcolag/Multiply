# Multiply
A simple multiplication-based multiplication puzzle.

___NOTE___: This is _very_ old code.  Like a lot of old projects, I'll try to whip it into a coherent shape, but it's fairly certain that there are no comments, terrible naming conventions, poor organization, and very possibly significant bugs.

_Multiply_ is a simple puzzle game, where the user can guess and deduce which letters (`A` through `J`) map to which digits (`0` through `9`).  Running the program produces the following:

      HJD
    x  CF
    -----
    FBEDD
    (0 guesses - 0 wrong)
    
     > 

While I'm certain this idea isn't at all original to me in any respect, I don't recall where I first saw it, and have written and lost several versions, over the years.
